# Hi there, I'm Amir Mohammad! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer and technology instructor specializing in building scalable software solutions and mentoring the next generation of developers. With extensive experience in backend, frontend, and mobile application development, I am always eager to learn and grow.

I identify as a polyglot developer, proficient in a wide range of programming languages. My primary focus is on **Python** and **C++**, but I have also worked on various projects using **Java**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **PHP**, and **Go**.

In the web domain, I've worked with modern frameworks like **Laravel**, **Django**, and **Flask** for backend development, and **Angular**, **Vue**, and **React** for creating engaging frontend user interfaces. My experience also extends to desktop development with **Qt** and **PyQt**, as well as mobile development with **Dart** and **Flutter**.

Beyond my technical skills, I believe that a project's success is not solely dependent on good code. I place high value on **soft skills (High EQ)** and effective communication. I am known to be a collaborative and proactive team player, proficient in modern development tools such as **Git**, **GitHub**, **GitLab**, **Docker**, and specialized **JetBrains IDEs**.

My goal is to create clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I am currently seeking new opportunities to collaborate on challenging and impactful projects. Please check out my pinned repositories for a look at my latest work.
